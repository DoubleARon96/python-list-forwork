# python-list-for-work
fuctions to modify html lists and export as a csv and txt
# Making a List

To work this you need the python extension to run the terminal 

### Commands 
1. E.g you can write in any number and it adds it to the list in the html file
2. 'print' this will turn the html into a txt file without the tags
3. 'print.csv' this will turn the html into a csv file without the tags
3. 'stop' this will stop the function

if you come across the issue with deleting an item in the to and it dose not over write you can just over write and then save and write in the next thing you need to add.
